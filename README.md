# odin-recipes
odin-recipes is the project in the HTMl Foundations section in the Foundations course provided by The Odin Project.

In this project we are going to build a basic recipe website. This project is to check the HTML knowledge that I have learned in the HTML Foundations sections in the Foundations course. And also to familiarize with the git commands.
